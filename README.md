# Hiro-Hack3FrontEnd

## Instructions to run the project:

### 1. Install dependencies

`npm i`

### 2. Start the Frontend

`npm run dev`

### 3. Connect your wallet

### 4. Add a proposal by inputting the Title and Description

### 5. Vote for the proposal or Against it

### 6. Conclude the proposal

### 7. You can submit a new proposal by following steps 4-6.

### 8. Test our Get Proposal Data button to see data from our contract on the Testnet blockchain (This is an iteration on our bootstrap button from Hack 2 except this time - it works!). 

Notes: The contracts and predicate json file are included in this repo as this is where we tried to install Chainhook locally.
